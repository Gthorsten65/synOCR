known issues / limitations:
 -  The check whether a selected folder (INPUT, OUTPUT, BACKUP) is encrypted 
    and possibly not mounted does not work when running the program via the GUI
    (due to the known rights restrictions)

1.3.0 [2022-11-01]
  BUGFIXES:
 -  counting of log and backup files to be deleted was not correct under certain situations
 -  catching an error message if there are no docker images to be cleaned up
  IMPROVEMENT:
 -  YAML rules: if the value for condition not set - fallback to any
 -  Notification in the log when rule-based destination folders are found, but a conflicting setting is set in the GUI
 -  Profiles are now processed in alphabetical order (by profile name)
  IMPLEMENTATIONS:
 -  ðŸ”¥ Input folder monitoring included (need installed inotify-tools from here: https://synocommunity.com/package/inotify-tools)
    - a pulsing status icon in the gui indicates an active monitoring
 -  ðŸ”¥ new Python based date search implemented, which also finds written out months (gthorsten)
    - a start year for date search can defined in GUI
    - a year in future can be defined in GUI as latest year for search
 -  ðŸ”¥ support separator sheet - dokument split pattern can be configured in GUI
    - in GUI user can define: splitpage is first page, is last page or discard
 -  ðŸ”¥ Pictures in the source folder can be converted automatically
 -  option to reduce multiple spaces to one (helpful with RegEx)
 -  the number of pages is now determined with Python - Exiftool and pdfinfo become obsolete
 -  [YAML] all renaming parameter can be used as tagname components in YAML-rules (experimental)
 -  [YAML] tagname & tagname_RegEx can be combined:
    - use Â§tagname_RegEx in tagname and it will be replaced by tagname_RegEx
 -  Metadata will be add with Python - Exiftool become obsolete
    - set author (get author information from ocr options if set [--author john doe])
    - set creation date (depending on which one was defined: OCR, file date, now)
    - set keywords
 -  the conversion from YAML to JSON is no longer done with the binary yq but by Python
 -  logging deleted backup files in loglevel 2 
 -  [GUI] notify about updates in main page (because cphub.net is not working)
 -  [GUI] support for follow machine translated languages (by DeepL)
