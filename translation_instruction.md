### You miss your language in synOCR GUI? 

Then, you can help to translate synOCR in your language.  
(currently only the paket management is multilingual - the synOCR GUI will follow in a future release)

Translate text only between double quotation marks.  
It is also important that special characters remain in the same place. (e.g. \<br\> / \<b\> …)
