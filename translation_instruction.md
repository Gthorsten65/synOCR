### You miss your language in synOCR? 
Then, you can help to translate synOCR in your language.  
(currently only the paket management is multilingual - the synOCR GUI will follow in a future release)


Translate text only between double quotation marks.  
It is also important that special characters remain in the same place. (e.g. \<br\> / \<b\> â€¦)

**The following files are needed to translate:**
- ./Pack/scripts/lang/**\<language_code\>**
- ./Pack/WIZARD_UIFILES/uninstall\_uifile\_**\<language\_code\>**
- ./Pack/WIZARD_UIFILES/upgrade\_uifile\_**\<language\_code\>**
