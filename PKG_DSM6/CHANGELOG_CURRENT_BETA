1.3.99.6 [2023-03-11]
BUGFIXES:
 - [YAML] caseinsensitive was not definable
 - [GUI] fixed syntax error that caused a navigation error in the GUI
 - [SHELL] if two separation pages follow each other, this was result in an empty PDF file (thx @DeeKay1)

   An updated version of PyPDF2 (>= 3.0.0) fixes this bug
IMPROVEMENT:

 - [GUI] the warning for an invalid source directory now also contains the name of the affected profile
 - [SHELL] update find_dates.py to version 1.0.4 (thx @GThorsten)
 - [SHELL] update PyPDF2 version 2.3.1 to pypdf version 3.5.1
   Target files are now tagged with PDF version 1.7 (PDF/A), but are not yet fully compliant with the standard
 - [SHELL] no temporary data is stored in the destination folder now
IMPLEMENTATIONS:
 - [YAML] >multilineregex: true< can be set at subrule and for tagname_RegEx
   this will set the parameter -z for grep to find results over multi lines
 - [GUI] support for follow machine translated languages (by DeepL)
    - Korean
    - Norwegian
