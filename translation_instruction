You miss your language in synOCR? 
Then, you can help to translate synOCR in your language. 
(currently only paketmanagement is multilingual - the synOCR GUI follows in a future release)


Translate text between double quotes only. 
It is also important, that special characters stay still at the same position (e.g. <br> / <b> â€¦)
  
*The following files are needed to translate:*
  ./Pack/scripts/lang/<language_code>
  ./Pack/WIZARD_UIFILES/uninstall_uifile_<language_code>
  ./Pack/WIZARD_UIFILES/upgrade_uifile_<language_code>
  
  
*The following languages are possible:*
  ger = German
  enu = English US
  chs = Chinese simplified
  cht = Chinese traditional
  csy = Czech
  jpn = Japanese
  krn = Korean
  dan = Danish
  fre = French
  ita = Italian
  nld = Dutch
